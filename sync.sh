# ------------------------------ Explanation of rsync output ------------------------------
# Reading the -i (itemize) output: each line is an 11-character code, YXcstpoguax
#
#   >f+++++++++ path/to/file
#   ||\________/
#   ||    └─ which attributes differ
#   |└─ type of item
#   └─ direction / whether anything is transferred
#
# Char 1 — what happens:
#   >   file is being RECEIVED (down)
#   <   file is being SENT (up)
#   c   item is being created locally (directory, symlink)
#   .   nothing is transferred, only metadata differs
#   *   a message follows instead of a code, e.g. "*deleting"
#
# Char 2 — what it is:
#   f   file      d   directory      L   symlink
#
# Chars 3-11 — which attributes differ (c s t p o g u a x):
#   c   checksum / content differs
#   s   size differs
#   t   modification time differs
#   p   permissions differ
#   o   owner differs        (suppressed here by --no-o)
#   g   group differs        (suppressed here by --no-g)
#   u   access time differs
#   a   ACL differs          x   extended attributes differ
#   +   the item is brand new, so every attribute counts as new
#   .   this attribute is unchanged
#
# Common lines:
#   >f+++++++++   new file, transferred
#   >f..t......   existing file, only the timestamp changed -> re-sent
#   >f.st......   existing file, size and time changed -> updated
#   cd+++++++++   directory created
#   .f.....g...   NOTHING transferred, only group metadata (noise)
#   *deleting     file removed (only appears with --delete)
#
# Rule of thumb: a leading '.' means no data moves. Only '>' and '<' transfer.
